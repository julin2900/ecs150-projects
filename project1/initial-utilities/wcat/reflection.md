1. How did using Claude Code change your development process?

It made me think more about the specifics before actually coding it. I normally read the requirements and start programming. My thought and problem-solving process occurs as I work. When using Claude Code, I needed to consider a lot of things in the beginning. Elements such as how it should specifically operate and handling a few edge cases / errors are normally stated in the prompt. I would say AI-assistance was extremely useful in tackling edge cases and errors (can't say to the fully extent, since this assignment we are required to have no manually typed code). Also pretty helpful in creating test cases since it can think of edge cases I didn't consider. Overall, I found this experience insightful since it shed some light how well it works in developing and handling errors that I normally wouldn't have caught.

2. What challenges did you encounter with AI-assisted development?

The hardest challenge for me was coming up with the prompt/specification. It was difficult coming up with a thorough enough prompt while being concise, so it doesn't go around doing its own thing. I had to iterate a few times - sometimes the AI would interpret things differently than I intended, or it would add features I didn't ask for. Finding the right balance between being too vague (where it might miss important details) and too specific (where the prompt becomes overwhelming) was tricky. Other than that, there wasn't anything that was too difficult. Just creating and laying out the specifics and intended behavior was difficult. I also had to be careful to make sure it followed the requirements exactly.

3. Did you understand the code Claude Code generated? How did you verify this?

Yes, I understood the code. I read through it and traced through how it works. Having the accept edits on feature was also playing a part, as I can view the changes before accepting or have it do something else. It is like watching someone program in front of your own eyes. This makes it easy for the prompter to digest what the AI assitance is doing. The code uses a helper function to format line numbers and tracks when it's at the start of a line to know when to add the line number prefix. To verify it was correct, I tested it with different files and edge cases like empty files and files without trailing newlines. I also compared the output format with standard Unix cat -n to make sure it matched (Claude Code was helpful in this part as I asked what is the typical behavior of the Unix cat -n feature). Running the test suite helped confirm everything worked as expected.


4. How did you decide what tests to write?

First few tests were cases I thought off the top of my head. Things like testing basic functionality with a single file, multiple files, and checking that the -n flag actually works. The rest I had Claude Code generate for me, since I couldn't think of it in the moment. It suggested edge cases I hadn't considered, like empty files, files without trailing newlines, files with only newlines, and testing error handling when files don't exist. Like I mentioned before, AI assistance is extremely helpful in noticing cases I haven't considered. After running the initial tests, I also added a few more based on what I saw - testing that line numbers continue correctly across multiple files and verifying the exact format matches Unix cat -n behavior.
